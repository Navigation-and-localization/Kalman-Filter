# Kalman-Filter

## what is kalman filter?

In statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements
observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than
those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after
Rudolf E. Kálmán, who was one of the primary developers of its theory.
